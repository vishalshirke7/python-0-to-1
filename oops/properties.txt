======> ASSOCIATION - https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/association-composition-aggregation-java/


1. Association represents the relationship between the objects. Here, one object can be associated with one object or many objects. There can be four types of association between the objects. Association can be undirectional or bidirectional
  - One to One
  - One to Many
  - Many to One, and
  - Many to Many


2. Association is a relation between two separate classes which establishes through their Objects. Association can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many. In Object-Oriented programming, an Object communicates to another object to use functionality and services provided by that object. Composition and Aggregation are the two forms of association. 


======> AGGREGATION

It is a special form of Association where:  

It represents Has-A’s relationship.
It is a unidirectional association i.e. a one-way relationship. For example, a department can have students but vice versa is not possible and thus unidirectional in nature.
In Aggregation, both the entries can survive individually which means ending one entity will not affect the other entity.



======> COMPOSITION

Composition is a restricted form of Aggregation in which two entities are highly dependent on each other.  

It represents part-of relationship.
In composition, both entities are dependent on each other.
When there is a composition between two entities, the composed object cannot exist without the other entity.


AGGREGATION VS COMPOSITION

1. Dependency: Aggregation implies a relationship where the child can exist independently of the parent. For example, Bank and Employee, delete the Bank and the Employee still exist. whereas Composition implies a relationship where the child cannot exist independent of the parent. Example: Human and heart, heart don’t exist separate to a Human

2. Type of Relationship: Aggregation relation is “has-a” and composition is “part-of” relation.

3. Type of association: Composition is a strong Association whereas Aggregation is a weak Association.
